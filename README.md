## Embedding V8 - 23/01/21

Embedding v8 in a C++ application on Windows 10 x64 has proven to be extremely tedious and difficult. The student has managed to build the engine on Windows 10 x64 but has not managed to successfully compile the hello-world.cc example provided by Google. The student has spent just over a month attempting to compile v8 on windows which has significantly delayed the projects progress. Due to the projects time constraints, the student has decided to use python instead of javascript as a scripting language due to there being more documentation and support online. The student has also tried using SpiderMonkey developed by Mozilla, but ran into similar issues as V8.
